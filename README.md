# Triangular Taper Transmission Line

This repository contains a complete microwave engineering project
on a triangular taper transmission line, including simulation,
PCB fabrication, and measurement.

The project is documented as a step-by-step report and supported
by simulation and measurement files for reference.

## Project Overview
The work follows a practical engineering workflow:
- Impedance profile design of a triangular taper
- Ideal transmission-line simulation (netlist)
- Electromagnetic geometry simulation
- PCB layout and fabrication
- Measurement using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
- Comparison between simulation and measurement

## Repository Structure
- `report/`
  - Final project report in PDF format (step-by-step explanation)

- `simulation/`
  - Sonnet netlist simulations (ideal models)
  - Sonnet geometry simulations (EM models)
  - Netlist vs geometry comparison

- `measurement/`
  - Measured S-parameter data (.s2p)
  - Measurement and comparison plots

- `pcb/`
  - PCB design information (EasyEDA)
  - Fabrication-related files

## Notes
- The PDF report is self-contained and explains the full process.
- Supporting files in this repository are provided for reference
  and project completeness.
