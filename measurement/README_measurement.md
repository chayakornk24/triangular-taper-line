obtained from the fabricated triangular taper
line using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).

Files included:
- measured.s2p : Measured results
- measurement_plot.png : Measured results
- comparison_plot.png : Comparison with geometry simulation

The measured results are compared with the
expanded box cell geometry simulation.
