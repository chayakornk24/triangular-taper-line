Simulation files for triangular taper transmission line.
This folder contains simulation files for the
triangular taper transmission line.

Two types of simulations are provided.

1. Netlist Simulation (Ideal Transmission Line Model)
   These simulations are used to study the ideal
   electrical behavior of the taper line.

   - 10 sections, 50 to 100 ohm
     simulation/netlist/10_sections_50to100/

   - 20 sections, 50 to 100 to 50 ohm
     simulation/netlist/20_sections_50to100to50/

2. Geometry Simulation (EM Model)
   These simulations include electromagnetic
   effects and are used for comparison with
   PCB measurement results.

   - Original box cell
     simulation/geometry/original_box/

   - Expanded box cell
     simulation/geometry/expanded_box/

The expanded box cell geometry simulation
was used for the final comparison with
measurement results.
